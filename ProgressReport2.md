#Our current progress:#

We are now able to draw as many bars as we want for our reactive audio visualizer. We also are able to move the bars individually
in whatever way we choose. Currently, they move in a sine wave formation, so it looks like the bars are riding over a wave. Additionally,
we colored the bars; They follow a blended rainbow pattern. 

#Up Next:#

Our next step is to start working with RTaudio and figure out how to capture data from songs to move the bars. We also need to work 
on how we want to use the FFT.
